If you have any concerns about Symphony or believe you have uncovered a vulnerability, please get in touch via DMs [@kriptonian8](https://x.com/kriptonian8). In the message, try to provide a description of the issue and ideally a way of reproducing it. The maintainers or me will get back to you as soon as possible.
